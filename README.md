<h4>Please answer the following questions by forking this project. Respond within the README file by editing it. Then submit your Github URL on Canvas</h4>
<ol>
 
 <h4>What does sheevpalpatine.java do? You can copy the code from above and use a browser ide here... https://www.compilejava.net/</h4>
 <ol>
 
 <li>The program sheevpalpatine.java is a program emphasizing palindromes in Java. A palindrome is a string that has the same value when reversed. A perfect example of a palindrome is the word dad because when reversed it has the same exact value and remains unchanged. The program analyzes the word "reliefpfpfeiller" to check if it's a palindrome.</l1>
  
  <h4>Submit a binary search example by adding a file to this project after forking it. Be sure to explain how the example functions using comments or in this README.</h4>
  <ol>
 
 <li> A binary search in Java finds the specified value within an array. In the program example, the size of the array is declared as the length. The lowest number in the array is 0, so that is declared in the int low variable. The value we are looking for will lie between the low and high variables. .</li>
 </ol>
 
 
  <h4>Is a selection sort or a bubble sort faster?</h4>
